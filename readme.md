## Features
- Four tiers of every container with more storage space
- Advanced shulkerboxes
- Chests in every type of wood
- Barrels in every type of wood
- Storage barrels in every type of wood
- Minecart chests in every type of wood

## Chests

Normal chests have 27 slots of storage space. Each type of chest has a base tier and three addidtional tiers.

With each tier the chest gets 9 additional slots, so tier three chests are as big as a double chest. 
These chests are also able to be combined into double chests, providing double the storage space. 
Every chest also has its minecart chest variant.

## Advanced Shulkerboxes

Advanced shulkerboxes have the same storage space as a normal shulkerbox, but you can access its inventory by right-clicking the item.

##Barrels

Normal barrels have 27 slots of storage space. 
Each type of barrel has a base tier and three addidtional tiers. 
With each tier the barrel gets 9 additional slots, so tier three chests are as big as two barrels combined.

## Storage Barrels

Storage barrels can only store a single type of item. 
You can insert an item by right-clicking the front. 
Double right-clicking inserts all items of that type. 
You can take out a single item by left-clicking and a complete stack by shift + left-clicking. 
A barrel can store up to 3456 items, but this can be changed in the configuration file.

The stored item is displayed on the front of the barrel.
